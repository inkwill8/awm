**Arrow Functions**
==================

An arrow function is a concise way to define small, single-purpose functions in JavaScript.

**Basic Syntax**
-----------------

The syntax for an arrow function is as follows:

```javascript
(parameters) => {
  // function body
}
```

For example:

```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

### Single-Line Arrow Function
---------------------------

Arrows functions are handy for simple actions, especially for one-liners. They come in two flavors:

#### Without Curly Braces: `(...args) => expression`
The right side is an expression: the function evaluates it and returns the result.

*   Parentheses can be omitted if thereâ€™s only a single argument, e.g.: `n => n * 2`

### Multi-Statement Arrow Function
---------------------------------

#### With Curly Braces: `(...args) => { body }`
Brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function, but we need an explicit return to return 
something.

This format is useful for more complex functions that require multiple lines of code.

**Key Features**
----------------

*   **No explicit `return` statement**: The expression after the arrow (`=>`) is automatically returned.
*   **Lambda-like syntax**: Arrow functions are similar to lambda functions in other languages.

**When to Use Arrow Functions**
---------------------------------

Use arrow functions when:

*   You need a small, one-time-use function.
*   You want a more concise way of defining a simple function.
*   You're working with modern JavaScript features (ES6+).
